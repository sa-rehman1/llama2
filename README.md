Llama 2 Model Interface with Streamlit
Overview
In this project, we will use the Llama 2 model, an open-source NLP model provided by Ollama, and create an interface for it using Streamlit. The interface will allow users to interact with the Llama 2 model and perform various NLP tasks through a user-friendly web application.

Introduction to Llama 2
Llama 2 is an open-source NLP model developed by Ollama. It is designed to perform various natural language processing tasks such as text generation, summarization, and sentiment analysis. In this project, we will leverage Llama 2's capabilities to build an interactive interface.

Creating the Streamlit Interface
We will create a web application using Streamlit to interact with the Llama 2 model. The Streamlit app will include the following features:

Input field for users to enter text.
Buttons to perform different NLP tasks using Llama 2.
Display area for showing the results of the NLP tasks.
Usage
After setting up the environment and installing the required packages, you can run the Streamlit application to start interacting with the Llama 2 model. Follow these steps:

Ensure all dependencies are installed.
Run the Streamlit application.
Open the provided URL in a web browser to access the interface.
Enter text into the input field and select the desired NLP task.
View the results displayed in the application.
